# Issue tracker: Local Markdown

Issues and specs for this project live as Markdown files in `.scratch/`.

## Conventions

- One feature per directory: `.scratch/<feature-slug>/`.
- The spec is `.scratch/<feature-slug>/spec.md`.
- Implementation issues are one file per ticket at `.scratch/<feature-slug>/issues/<NN>-<slug>.md`, numbered from `01`, never a single combined tickets file.
- Record ticket state as a `Status:` line near the top of each issue file. No triage label vocabulary is configured because the `triage` skill is not installed.
- Append comments and conversation history to the bottom of the file under a `## Comments` heading.

## When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker"

Create the appropriate spec or individual issue file under `.scratch/<feature-slug>/`, creating directories as needed.

## When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket"

Read the file at the referenced path. The user will normally pass the path or the issue number directly. If only a number is provided, resolve it within the relevant feature directory.

## Wayfinding operations

Used by `/wayfinder` if installed later. The map is a file with one child file per ticket.

- **Map**: `.scratch/<effort>/map.md` (the Notes / Decisions-so-far / Fog body).
- **Child ticket**: `.scratch/<effort>/issues/NN-<slug>.md`, numbered from `01`, with the question in the body. A `Type:` line records `research`, `prototype`, `grilling`, or `task`; a `Status:` line records `claimed` or `resolved` after claiming or resolving.
- **Blocking**: a `Blocked by: NN, NN` line near the top. A ticket is unblocked when every file it lists is `resolved`.
- **Frontier**: scan `.scratch/<effort>/issues/` for files that are open, unblocked, and unclaimed; first by number wins.
- **Claim**: set `Status: claimed` and save before any work.
- **Resolve**: append the answer under an `## Answer` heading, set `Status: resolved`, then append a context pointer (gist + link) to the map's Decisions-so-far in `map.md`.
